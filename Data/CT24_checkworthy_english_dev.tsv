6963	"There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem."	No

7033	Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.	Yes
7049	But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.	No
7064	"We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border."	Yes
7074	"And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs."	No

Yes
7142	What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.	No

7596	There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.	No
7600	In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.	Yes
7637	"But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev."	No
7650	I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.	No

7743	There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.	Yes
7747	Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.	No
7789	"We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed."	Yes
7836	Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.	Yes

7944	We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.	Yes
7981	"But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world."	Yes
7994	You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.	Yes
8010	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.	Yes
8016	"I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line."	No

8124	I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.	Yes
8136	I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.	No
8164	That is the obligation upon our generation.	No
8188	Is the United States standing still?	No
8222	What kind of programs are we for?	No
8229	I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.	No
8239	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	No
8255	"Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee."	No
8310	In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.	No
8319	I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.	No

8411	"As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries."	Yes
8422	Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?	No
8437	My objection here is not the cost in dollars.	No
8460	And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.	Yes
8468	Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.	Yes
8533	That's why we have to continue to be alert.	No
8546	Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.	No
8551	"Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period."	Yes
8562	"I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government."	No
8596	And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.	No
8597	But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.	No
8605	The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.	Yes
8612	The means are at issue.	No
8668	"What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget."	Yes
8710	Why not leave it with them?	No
8718	"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself."	No
8778	"When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test."	Yes
8824	"That is just a downpayment, in my opinion."	No
8835	But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.	No
8876	"We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from."	Yes
8886	"And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities."	Yes
8928	"And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income."	Yes
8961	This is 1980 and not 1966.	No
8974	"Now also, with regard to the figures about California."	No
9000	"Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that."	No

9128	"Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate."	No
9130	"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, ""I've got my degree."	No
9136	We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.	No
9145	I know what it takes to get this economy going.	No
9150	I'm going to change that.	No
9164	"Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright."	No
9170	"And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone."	Yes

9243	We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.	Yes
9244	Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.	Yes
9247	We've also got to look to the future.	No
9255	"We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas."	Yes
9272	So where'd the increase come from?	No
9283	I was in coal country.	No
9292	I'll get America and North America energy independent.	No
9294	We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.	No
9332	How much did you cut them by?	No
9333	I'm happy to answer the question.	No
9348	Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.	Yes
9350	And production on gas --	No
9355	"And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up."	Yes
9367	I don't think the American people believe that.	No
9395	And we need to win that future.	No
9396	And I intend to win it as President of the United States.	No
9457	Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?	No
9461	"And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class."	No
9464	"A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration."	Yes
9475	"Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00."	Yes
9487	It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.	No
9494	I think that grows the economy.	No
9495	I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.	No

9627	"She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night."	No
9630	Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.	No
9632	"In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs."	Yes
9635	"I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago."	Yes
9640	An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.	Yes
9656	"Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."	Yes
9668	And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.	No

9817	The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.	Yes
9818	"The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans."	Yes
9829	"Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery."	Yes

10508	Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.	No
10513	"And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet."	No
10514	Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.	No
10555	"Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill."	Yes

10682	So we've got to deal with that right away.	No
10685	And we can do it.	No
10687	So that would be priority number one.	No

10771	"I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad."	No
10794	"So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in."	No
10799	"Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year."	Yes
10803	"Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street."	Yes
10815	I want to get to Medicare in a second.	No
10822	Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.	Yes
10834	"When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut."	Yes
10842	And our best days are ahead of us.	No
10859	"Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?"	No
10863	"Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs."	Yes
10874	"And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment."	No
10882	"And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times."	Yes
10889	We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.	No
10892	I'm just trying to keep up with John.	No
10899	I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.	No
10901	"By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth."	No
10927	"If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years."	Yes
10952	"Well, thank you for the question."	No
10955	And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.	No
10959	Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.	No
10967	"I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit."	No
10970	Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?	No
10974	But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.	No
10978	We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.	No
10998	So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.	No
11001	All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.	No
11025	"Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well."	No
11026	And that is one of the challenges that America faces.	No
11040	"Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand."	No
11049	"We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion."	Yes
11061	"Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake."	No
11062	"If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?"	No
11065	"And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible."	No
11070	Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.	Yes
11072	And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.	No
11074	"Well, let me just follow up, my friends."	No
11080	"And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again."	No
11081	But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.	No
11094	And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.	No
11112	"And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out."	No
11130	And that is to get the support of the people.	No
11132	"And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."	No
11145	It'd be fine with me.	No
11191	"We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan."	No
11195	And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.	No
11199	And I've had conversations with him.	No
11203	We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.	No
11204	We have to do a lot of things.	No
11210	We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.	No
11228	"But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors."	No
11234	And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.	No
11235	But we can't just provide moral support.	No
11240	"The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners."	No
11266	And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe.	Yes
11277	"Well, thank you, Terry (ph)."	No
11278	And thank you for your service to the country.	No
11293	And I think we can do that.	No
11295	"But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place."	No
11299	It would be a game-changer in the region.	No
11302	And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.	No
11313	"Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000."	Yes
11327	But here's what I do know.	No
11333	And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?	No
11340	That's what's at stake in this election.	No
11351	"There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans."	No
11354	I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business.	No
11357	I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.	No
11665	I thought that was a good model.	No
11676	I don't think we agree on that.	No
11975	And I think that's a private matter.	No
12145	"And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999."	No
12157	I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.	Yes
12163	We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.	Yes
12246	And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.	Yes
12540	"That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists."	Yes
12557	"And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies."	No
12568	"And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line."	No
12574	I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955.	Yes
12591	In 1957 I was in Havana.	No
12606	And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.	Yes
12609	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	Yes
12613	But are we doing enough in these areas?	No
12619	Are we doing enough in that area?	No
12651	I think we are today.	No
12690	"Now, what can we do?"	No
12701	"He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains."	Yes
12736	So that is my answer to this question.	No

12780	"What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world."	Yes
12791	"I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again."	No
12829	This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.	No
12832	"I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points."	No
12885	We can make it move.	No
12922	"If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."	No
12990	Let's talk about civil rights.	No
12994	Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.	No
13002	"It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world."	No

13122	The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.	Yes
13129	The treaty does not include these two islands.	Yes
13144	"Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris."	No
13149	There have been many wars in the history of mankind.	No
13153	"Now, we may not succeed."	No
13187	What do we do then?	No
13198	But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.	No
13206	"I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island."	No
13295	"I don't suggest that, I don't support it."	No
13303	"On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce."	No
13322	"Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate."	No
13346	The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.	No
13361	"My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history."	Yes

13396	"We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America."	No
13403	We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.	No
13462	And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.	No
13469	I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.	No
13502	I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.	No
13521	Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.	Yes
13790	I thought you'd forgotten I was here.	No
14104	So I have to stand up for myself.	No
14659	I don't think we're a declining nation.	No
14752	"Then the question is, can we govern?"	No
14890	"In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War."	Yes
14892	"In addition, we've brought down inflation."	Yes
14899	"And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation."	Yes
14911	We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.	Yes
14925	It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.	Yes
14926	It is now running at 12.7%.	Yes
14930	Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.	Yes

15167	"To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan."	No
15222	We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.	Yes
15259	I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.	No
15380	Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.	Yes
15409	I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.	No
15416	I've been President now for almost four years.	No
15418	"I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way."	No

15460	I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.	No
15462	We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.	Yes
15491	And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.	No
15525	"You know, the American people are fair."	No
15527	They want to judge it on the record itself.	No
15559	"And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that."	No
15561	And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.	No
15564	The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.	No
15565	And they know who appropriates the money.	No
15570	"And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them"	No
15578	"He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it."	Yes
15583	will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.	No
15597	"We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation."	No
15602	The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.	No
15607	I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.	No
15626	"As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that."	Yes
15632	"I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way."	No
15633	So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.	No
15638	"So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it."	No
15640	"And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people."	No
15641	"But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people."	No
15645	"I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin."	No
15646	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.	No
15648	"It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country."	No
15682	It's our vision of America.	No
15686	"I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better."	No
15689	That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.	No
15690	"But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues."	No
15718	"They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze."	No
15726	"Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay."	No
15730	Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.	No
15731	"Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent."	No
15750	So military security and economic security go hand in hand.	No
15751	And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	No
15763	Can we start the clock over?	No
15787	Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me.	No
15789	We were proud of them.	No
15796	"But more than that, they are role models."	No
15801	These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.	No
15810	"And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace."	No
15829	I had something very nice to say in there.	No
15842	And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.	No
15856	I salute those who participate in the political process.	No
15874	We may have different approaches.	No
15881	the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign.	No
15905	"But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it."	No
15930	It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction.	No
15933	"The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously."	Yes
15937	"See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel."	No
15938	I served at the UN.	No
15939	I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.	No
15947	We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.	No
15987	The Congress is doing a better job of it.	No
15989	But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.	No
16006	And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.	No
16014	I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year.	Yes
16015	He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.	Yes
16017	We do not have to do it.	No
16044	I won't support judges like that.	No
16046	But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret.	No
16047	"And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments."	No
16075	"Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income."	Yes
16093	"But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children."	No
16099	We're going to tell you how to do it all.	No
16101	You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.	No
16116	I just have to correct the record.	No
16128	"But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country."	No
16131	It's a contract between generations.	No
16154	"We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products."	Yes
16184	"So I'll just keep saying, I am one."	No
16186	I'm not going to do that.	No
16187	That boo was excessively loud.	No
16193	I believe in our parks.	No
16227	I will not agree to another debate.	No
16233	"In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it."	No
16236	But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.	No
16246	But it's not getting out because there are too few debates.	No
16256	"(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?"	No
16257	Most Americans believe in basic values.	No
16258	We have differences about how to achieve them.	No
16263	"But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success."	No
16269	But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces.	No
16274	"Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region."	No
16275	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	No
16276	"Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence."	No
16281	"And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries."	No
16307	Maybe the Vice President has an answer.	No
16308	But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.	No
16313	"Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?"	No
16315	"This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base."	No
16316	"I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power."	No
16320	So I am one who believes that we can	No
16332	I believe that public service is honorable.	No
16340	I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.	No
16388	Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.	No
16392	I want to invest in our children.	No
16402	"America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible."	No
16408	And I ask for your support on November 8th.	No
16410	"Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World."	No
16467	"Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time."	No
16502	"When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s."	Yes
16509	And this is why a tax reform is so important.	No
16528	"I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now."	Yes
16579	"But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair."	No
16600	We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.	No
16615	"The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement."	Yes
16626	We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.	No
16631	In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.	Yes
16674	We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.	No

16853	And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.	Yes
16857	Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.	Yes
16882	But I think the feeling is misplaced.	No
16896	That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.	No
16909	"If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation."	No

17110	"At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues."	Yes

17121	"As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion."	Yes
17134	"I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference."	No
17138	"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need."	Yes

Yes
17331	"It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it."	No

17476	This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.	No
17485	But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.	No
17506	You've got another life involved.	No
17509	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	No
17523	"But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?"	No
17550	"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around."	Yes
17578	I'm not going to increase taxes.	No

17655	Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.	Yes
17667	That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.	No
17681	Certainly education and training is crucial.	No
17686	I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.	No
17692	"We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year."	Yes
17695	I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.	No
17721	There's no way of glossing around that.	No
17749	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	No
17766	Will you finally touch that defense budget?	No
17773	"I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82."	No

18007	People out there listening know what I believe.	No
18074	It's the hardest decision a president makes.	No
18117	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	No
18120	They just need the help to be trained.	No
18139	This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.	No
18225	"But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again."	No
18380	I understand how hard it is.	No
18381	I get the casualty reports every day.	No
18410	It's what leadership is based on.	No
18412	"I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do."	No
18509	"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""	No

No

26564	Those are my best ideas about it.	No
26794	All the people who may still be watching or viewing.	No

26982	But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.	No
